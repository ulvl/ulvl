========================================================================

ulvl provides classes for loading and saving generic level formats.  It
can be used to develop a generic level editor, and to load levels into a
game generated by such an editor.  Basic support for loading the Tiled
TMX format is also provided, enabling use of Tiled with your game.


INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>

Once you have all the dependencies, install ulvl with the included
setup.py script, e.g. with "python3 setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "ulvl" folder into the same
directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good idea
for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.


USAGE

There are various different classes for handling the different formats.
Each native class (ASCL, JSL, ULX) has a save method and a load class
method, while the TMX class only has a load class method.  Use these
classes to read and write files.

See the documentation found in the doc folder for detailed information.
